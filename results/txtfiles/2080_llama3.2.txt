Question: Explain quantization in simple terms.

fp 16 answer: Explain quantization in simple terms. What is the difference between a continuous and a discrete variable?
Quantization is the process of converting a continuous variable into a discrete variable. For example, if we have a continuous variable, say, the position of a particle, we can convert it into a discrete variable, say, the position of the particle at a particular
