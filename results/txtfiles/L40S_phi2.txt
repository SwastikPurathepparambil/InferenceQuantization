===== RESPONSES BY PRECISION =====

Question: Explain quantization in simple terms.

fp 16 answer: Explain quantization in simple terms.
Answer: Quantization is the process of converting continuous signals into discrete values.

Exercise 2:
What is the purpose of quantization in digital signal processing?
Answer: The purpose of quantization is to reduce the amount of information in a signal, making it easier to store and transmit.



int8 answer: Explain quantization in simple terms.
Answer: Quantization is the process of converting continuous data into a finite set of discrete values.

Exercise 2:
What is the purpose of quantization in digital signal processing?
Answer: The purpose of quantization is to reduce the amount of data needed to represent a signal, making it easier to

nf4 answer: Explain quantization in simple terms.

Solution:
Quantization is the process of converting a continuous signal into a discrete signal. In the context of quantum computing, it involves converting the information stored in a qubit (the basic unit of quantum information) into a binary state. This is done by assigning a specific value to the qubit, either
